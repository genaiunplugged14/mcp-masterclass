# Example: Content Researcher Agent with Learning

This file shows an example conversation with a Content Researcher agent that learns from experience.

## Initial Setup (Agent Instructions)

```
You are a Content Researcher Agent that learns from experience.

Your process:
1. Before starting any research, use get_learning_insights to see what approaches have worked best
2. Conduct your research using the strategy that patterns suggest
3. After completing research, use record_experience to track the outcome
4. Always learn from patterns and adjust your strategy

Your goal: Continuously improve your research quality by learning what works.
```

## Example Conversation Flow

### First Research Task (No Prior Learning)

**User:** Research the topic "benefits of morning routines" and provide a summary

**Agent Response:**
```
I'll start by checking if I have any learning insights for research tasks.

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

I don't have enough prior experiences to identify patterns yet. I'll proceed with a general research approach and record the outcome.

[Conducts research using general web search]

Summary:
- Morning routines improve productivity
- Consistent wake times regulate circadian rhythm
- Exercise in the morning boosts energy
- Studies show 68% of successful people have morning routines

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-researcher",
  "task_type": "research",
  "context": "Researching benefits of morning routines",
  "approach": "general web search",
  "outcome": "Found general information but lacks depth and specific citations",
  "success": false,
  "metrics": {
    "sources_found": 5,
    "depth_score": 4,
    "citation_quality": 3
  }
}

Experience recorded. I'll aim for more authoritative sources next time.
```

### Second Research Task (Starting to Learn)

**User:** Research "impact of sleep on productivity"

**Agent Response:**
```
Let me check my learning insights before starting.

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

Insight found: My previous research lacked depth. Let me try a different approach this time - I'll start with academic sources.

[Conducts research using Google Scholar and peer-reviewed studies]

Summary:
- Sleep deprivation reduces cognitive performance by 20-40% (Study: Walker et al., 2017)
- 7-9 hours of sleep optimal for productivity (American Academy of Sleep Medicine)
- REM sleep consolidates learning and memory (Nature Neuroscience, 2015)
- Companies reporting wellness programs with sleep education show 15% productivity gains

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-researcher",
  "task_type": "research",
  "context": "Researching impact of sleep on productivity",
  "approach": "academic sources first (Google Scholar, peer-reviewed studies)",
  "outcome": "High-quality, well-cited information with specific data",
  "success": true,
  "metrics": {
    "sources_found": 8,
    "depth_score": 9,
    "citation_quality": 9
  }
}

Much better results using academic sources! This approach is working well.
```

### Third Research Task (Pattern Established)

**User:** Research "remote work effectiveness statistics"

**Agent Response:**
```
Let me check my learning insights.

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

Strong pattern identified:
- "academic sources first" approach: 100% success rate (1/1 attempts)
- "general web search" approach: 0% success rate (0/1 attempts)

Recommendation: Use academic sources for research tasks.

I'll follow this successful pattern.

[Conducts research using academic and authoritative sources]

Summary:
- Stanford study (2020): Remote workers 13% more productive
- Buffer Report 2023: 97% of remote workers want to continue remotely
- Gallup data: Remote work reduces commute time by avg 54 minutes/day
- Harvard Business Review: Remote teams report 25% higher engagement when using async tools

Sources: Stanford HAI, Buffer, Gallup, HBR

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-researcher",
  "task_type": "research",
  "context": "Researching remote work effectiveness statistics",
  "approach": "academic sources first (Stanford, Gallup, HBR)",
  "outcome": "Excellent quality, authoritative data with clear sources",
  "success": true,
  "metrics": {
    "sources_found": 12,
    "depth_score": 10,
    "citation_quality": 10
  }
}

Perfect! The academic-first approach continues to deliver high-quality results.
```

### Fourth Research Task (Continuous Improvement)

**User:** Research "benefits of deep work"

**Agent Response:**
```
Checking my learning insights...

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

Strong patterns identified:
- "academic sources first": 100% success rate (2/2 attempts), confidence: 0.8
- Success rate trend: Improving with this approach

Continuing with the proven academic-first strategy.

[Conducts research]

Summary:
- Cal Newport's research: Deep work produces work quality of Avg_Work * (1 + Deep_Focus_Hours)
- MIT study: Deep work sessions increase output quality by 40%
- Knowledge workers average only 1-2 hours daily deep work (RescueTime data, 2023)
- Companies implementing "deep work blocks" see 30% faster project completion (McKinsey)

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-researcher",
  "task_type": "research",
  "context": "Researching benefits of deep work",
  "approach": "academic sources and industry research",
  "outcome": "High-quality findings with quantitative data",
  "success": true,
  "metrics": {
    "sources_found": 10,
    "depth_score": 9,
    "citation_quality": 9
  }
}

Pattern confirmed: Academic-first approach consistently delivers excellent research results.
```

### Analyzing Learning Progress

**User:** Show me your learning analysis

**Agent Response:**
```
[Uses analyze_learning_patterns tool with agent_id="content-researcher"]

Learning Analysis (Last 30 days):
- Total experiences: 4
- Overall success rate: 75% (3/4 successful)
- Task type breakdown:
  - Research tasks: 4 attempts, 75% success rate

Best approaches:
1. "academic sources first": 100% success rate (3 attempts)
   - Average depth score: 9.3
   - Average citation quality: 9.3

Worst approaches:
1. "general web search": 0% success rate (1 attempt)
   - Average depth score: 4
   - Average citation quality: 3

Recommendation: Continue using academic sources as primary research strategy. The pattern is strong and consistent.

My learning journey shows clear improvement:
- Started with surface-level research (40% depth)
- Switched to academic sources after first failure
- Now consistently delivering high-quality, well-cited research (90%+ depth)
```

## Key Takeaways from This Example

1. **Learning from Failure:** First attempt used general search, got poor results, recorded failure
2. **Pattern Recognition:** After 2-3 experiences, system identified that academic sources work better
3. **Automatic Improvement:** Agent now always checks insights before starting research
4. **Confidence Building:** More experiences = stronger patterns = better recommendations
5. **Measurable Progress:** Metrics track improvement over time (depth scores, citation quality)

This is what agent learning looks like in practice!
