# Example: Content Writer Agent with Learning

This file shows an example conversation with a Content Writer agent that learns from experience.

## Initial Setup (Agent Instructions)

```
You are a Content Writer Agent that learns from experience.

Your process:
1. Before writing any content, use get_learning_insights to see what writing approaches have worked best
2. Create your content using the strategy that patterns suggest
3. After completing content, use record_experience to track the outcome and reader engagement
4. Always learn from patterns and adjust your writing style

Your goal: Continuously improve your writing quality by learning what resonates with readers.
```

## Example Conversation Flow

### First Writing Task (No Prior Learning)

**User:** Write a LinkedIn post about the benefits of morning routines (aim for 150-200 words)

**Agent Response:**
```
I'll start by checking if I have any learning insights for writing tasks.

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

I don't have enough prior experiences to identify patterns yet. I'll proceed with a standard informative approach and record the outcome.

**Morning Routines: The Key to Productivity**

Morning routines are important for success. Many successful people wake up early and follow a structured routine. Research shows that having a morning routine can improve your productivity throughout the day.

Some benefits include:
- Better focus and concentration
- Increased energy levels
- More time for important tasks
- Reduced stress and anxiety

Starting your day with intention makes a big difference. Consider implementing a morning routine to boost your productivity and achieve your goals.

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-writer",
  "task_type": "writing",
  "context": "LinkedIn post about morning routines",
  "approach": "standard informative list format",
  "outcome": "Functional but generic, lacks personality and specific examples",
  "success": false,
  "metrics": {
    "word_count": 98,
    "readability_score": 6,
    "engagement_prediction": 3,
    "personality_score": 2
  }
}

Experience recorded. This feels too generic and doesn't stand out. I need to try a different approach.
```

### Second Writing Task (Starting to Learn)

**User:** Write a LinkedIn post about time management strategies

**Agent Response:**
```
Let me check my learning insights before starting.

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

Insight found: My previous post was too generic and lacked personality. Let me try a story-driven approach with specific examples.

[Writes content]

**I used to think I was "bad at time management."**

Turns out, I was just playing calendar Tetris.

Here's what changed everything:

I stopped trying to fit MORE into my day. Instead, I started protecting 3 things:

→ 2 hours of deep work (morning, no meetings)
→ 30 minutes of planning (Sunday evening)
→ 1 hour of buffer time (for the chaos that always happens)

Result after 3 weeks:
- Finished 2 major projects I'd been avoiding for months
- Stopped feeling constantly behind
- Actually left work at 5pm most days

Time management isn't about doing more. It's about protecting what matters most.

What's your non-negotiable time block?

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-writer",
  "task_type": "writing",
  "context": "LinkedIn post about time management",
  "approach": "story-driven with personal example and specific outcomes",
  "outcome": "More engaging, relatable hook, clear structure with results",
  "success": true,
  "metrics": {
    "word_count": 127,
    "readability_score": 9,
    "engagement_prediction": 8,
    "personality_score": 9
  }
}

Much better! The story-driven approach with specific numbers resonates more than generic advice.
```

### Third Writing Task (Pattern Established)

**User:** Write a LinkedIn post about remote work productivity

**Agent Response:**
```
Let me check my learning insights.

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

Strong pattern identified:
- "story-driven with specific examples" approach: 100% success rate (1/1 attempts)
- "standard informative list" approach: 0% success rate (0/1 attempts)

Recommendation: Use story-driven approach for writing tasks.

I'll follow this successful pattern.

[Writes content]

**My productivity crashed when I went remote.**

Then I realized: I was trying to recreate my office at home.

Wrong strategy.

Here's what actually worked:

**Stop 1: Separate spaces**
I moved my "office" from the bedroom to a corner of the living room. Physical boundary = mental boundary.

**Stop 2: Eliminate decision fatigue**
Same breakfast. Same workout time. Same "work outfit" (yes, even at home).

**Stop 3: Communicate boundaries**
Slack status: "Deep work until 11am" → Response time expectations set.

Result after 30 days:
- Shipped 40% more features than in-office baseline
- Zero burnout symptoms
- Team collaboration improved (async > constant meetings)

Remote work isn't office work from home. It's a completely different operating system.

What remote work hack changed everything for you?

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-writer",
  "task_type": "writing",
  "context": "LinkedIn post about remote work productivity",
  "approach": "story-driven problem/solution with numbered framework",
  "outcome": "High engagement potential, clear structure, relatable problem",
  "success": true,
  "metrics": {
    "word_count": 156,
    "readability_score": 9,
    "engagement_prediction": 9,
    "personality_score": 9
  }
}

Excellent! The story + framework combination is working consistently.
```

### Fourth Writing Task (Refinement & Experimentation)

**User:** Write a short post about the importance of breaks during work

**Agent Response:**
```
Checking my learning insights...

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

Strong patterns identified:
- "story-driven with specific examples": 100% success rate (2/2 attempts), confidence: 0.8
- Numbered frameworks increase clarity
- Concrete outcomes (percentages, time saved) improve credibility

I'll combine these proven elements.

[Writes content]

**I hit a wall at 2pm every day.**

Brain fog. Checking email for the 12th time. Pretending to work.

Then I tried something counterintuitive: I stopped powering through.

**New rule: Hard stop every 90 minutes.**

Not "check Slack" breaks. Real breaks:
→ Walk outside (even 5 minutes)
→ Completely different activity
→ No screens

What happened after 2 weeks:

Before breaks:
- 6 hours at desk = 3 hours of real work
- Exhausted by 4pm

After breaks:
- 5 hours at desk = 4.5 hours of real work
- Energy until 6pm
- Better quality output

The math doesn't lie: Less time working = more work done.

When's your last real break today?

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-writer",
  "task_type": "writing",
  "context": "LinkedIn post about work breaks",
  "approach": "story-driven with before/after comparison and specific metrics",
  "outcome": "Clear value prop, relatable problem, concrete data, engaging question",
  "success": true,
  "metrics": {
    "word_count": 143,
    "readability_score": 9,
    "engagement_prediction": 9,
    "personality_score": 9
  }
}

Pattern confirmed: Story + specific numbers + before/after = consistent high engagement.
```

### Fifth Writing Task (Different Format - Testing Adaptability)

**User:** Write a short thought-provoking post about AI and creativity (no lists, just a provocative observation)

**Agent Response:**
```
Let me check insights and adapt to the different format requirement.

[Uses get_learning_insights tool]

Patterns show story-driven approaches work well. For a thought-provoking observation without lists, I'll use the same personal voice but focus on a single sharp insight.

[Writes content]

**Everyone's worried AI will replace creative work.**

I'm worried about the opposite.

What if AI makes us TOO efficient at the mediocre stuff?

You can now generate 100 social posts in 10 minutes. 50 blog outlines in 5 minutes. 20 email variations instantly.

But here's what I've noticed after 6 months using AI daily:

I'm producing 10x more content. But I'm not producing 10x more IDEAS.

The bottleneck shifted. It's not execution anymore. It's "what's worth saying?"

AI didn't automate creativity. It exposed that most of what we called "creative work" was actually just formatting.

The question isn't "can AI write?" It's "do you have something worth writing?"

That's the skill we should be practicing.

[Uses record_experience tool]
{
  "agent_id": "content-writer",
  "task_type": "writing",
  "context": "Thought-provoking post about AI and creativity, no list format",
  "approach": "provocative observation with counterintuitive insight",
  "outcome": "Sharp central idea, challenges assumptions, engages without prescribing",
  "success": true,
  "metrics": {
    "word_count": 138,
    "readability_score": 9,
    "engagement_prediction": 9,
    "personality_score": 9,
    "format_adherence": 10
  }
}

Successfully adapted the story-driven voice to a different format. The core pattern (personal voice + specific observation + question at the end) still works.
```

### Analyzing Learning Progress

**User:** Show me your writing improvement analysis

**Agent Response:**
```
[Uses analyze_learning_patterns tool with agent_id="content-writer"]

Learning Analysis (Last 30 days):
- Total experiences: 5
- Overall success rate: 80% (4/5 successful)
- Task type breakdown:
  - Writing tasks: 5 attempts, 80% success rate

Best approaches:
1. "story-driven with specific examples": 100% success rate (4 attempts)
   - Average engagement prediction: 8.75
   - Average personality score: 9
   - Average readability: 9

2. "before/after comparison with metrics": 100% success rate (2 attempts)
   - Average engagement prediction: 9
   - Concrete data increases credibility

Worst approaches:
1. "standard informative list": 0% success rate (1 attempt)
   - Average engagement prediction: 3
   - Average personality score: 2
   - Too generic, lacks differentiation

Pattern Evolution:
- Week 1: Generic informative style (40% engagement potential)
- Week 2: Discovered story-driven approach (80% engagement)
- Week 3: Added specific metrics and frameworks (90% engagement)
- Week 4: Successfully adapted pattern to different formats

Key Insights:
1. Personal voice consistently outperforms impersonal advice
2. Specific numbers (percentages, time periods) increase credibility
3. Questions at the end drive engagement
4. Before/after comparisons make value clear
5. The story-driven pattern adapts to multiple formats

Recommendation: Continue using story-driven approach with specific examples. Experiment with different narrative structures while maintaining core pattern (personal hook + specific outcome + engaging question).

My writing has measurably improved:
- Started with generic list posts (engagement score: 3/10)
- Now consistently producing high-engagement content (score: 9/10)
- Pattern recognition allows format flexibility while maintaining quality
```

## Key Takeaways from This Example

1. **Learning from Failure:** First post was generic, got low engagement scores, recorded failure
2. **Pattern Recognition:** After 2-3 posts, system identified story-driven approach works better
3. **Automatic Improvement:** Writer now checks insights before creating content
4. **Format Adaptability:** Learned patterns transfer across different content formats
5. **Measurable Progress:** Engagement scores improved from 3/10 to 9/10 consistently

## Comparison: Writer vs Researcher Learning

**Researcher Agent learns:**
- Source quality (academic vs general)
- Research depth
- Citation standards
- Data accuracy

**Writer Agent learns:**
- Engagement patterns (story vs list)
- Voice effectiveness (personal vs formal)
- Structure formats (frameworks vs narrative)
- Reader resonance (specific vs generic)

**Same learning system, different domains, both improve automatically.**

## Advanced Writer Agent Variations

### SEO Writer Agent
```
Tracks:
- Keyword placement effectiveness
- Title click-through rates
- Content length vs ranking
- Internal linking success
```

### Email Writer Agent
```
Tracks:
- Subject line open rates
- CTA click-through rates
- Response rates
- Tone effectiveness (casual vs formal)
```

### Social Media Writer Agent
```
Tracks:
- Post format performance (carousel vs single)
- Hook effectiveness
- Engagement rates
- Optimal posting times
```

All use the same three learning tools. Different contexts, same improvement mechanism.

This is what agent learning looks like in practice!
