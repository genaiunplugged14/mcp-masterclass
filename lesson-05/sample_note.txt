This is my first MCP server.

MCP lets Claude Desktop connect to tools I create.
Those tools can read data, write data, or trigger actions.

Now Claude can use my custom tools to help me get work done.
This opens up endless possibilities for automation and AI assistance.

The patterns I'm learning in this lesson will scale to much more complex systems.
